# NEARxMACI

NEVO's main goal is to provide users with a smooth voting experience without compromising the privacy-based, bribe-resistant system of MACI.

 MACI is an anti-collusion voting system that prevents bribery using ZKPs. According to the documentation, the MACI ecosystem's goal by 2030 is to utilize MACI in national elections.This can be achievable even if citizens who have never heard of blockchain can vote with the system.

 Thanks to Near's technology called Cross-Chain Signatures, users can use their Near wallet to sign transactions across many blockchain protocols.

 By connecting these groundbreaking technologies, we present "NEVO"! NEVO utilizes Near Protocol's Cross-Chain Signatures and MACI's secure, private, and bribe-resistant voting system. This provides a simple and secure user experience, so much so that we believe even a 70-year-old person with an email can vote in the elections.
